This game was developed by me (Arturo Iafrate), Pasquale Celardo, Vincenzo Selvaggio and Francesco Rosano during the S7 course at the iOS Foundation Program organized by the University of Naples "Parthenope" in partnership with Apple.

The app is published on the appstore, it's free and supports both iPhone and iPad. You can download the app here: https://itunes.apple.com/it/app/playingreen/id1257728960?l=en&mt=8
